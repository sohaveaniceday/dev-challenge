# Candidate Notes

## Instructions for initialising demo

From the project root folder:

```
yarn
yarn seed
yarn start:server 
yarn start:client 
```

## Challenge Walk-through

I have completed the task as described by:

* Creating an backend API, written in Node.js
* Creating a seeds file that inputs the prescribed sample data into the API
* Adding React to the frontend 
* Incorporating SASS to styling
* Adding a test file using Mocha, Chai and SuperTest to test the backend  ('yarn test' to initiate testing)

## Biggest Challenge

The biggest challenge was handling the different products the suppliers possessed. I wanted the user to only be able to select a product if a company had it in their roster. To achieve this I disabled the dropdown for the product selector until the supplier has been chosen - the API then makes a call and retrieves all the products that supplier has and fills in the supplier dropdown, enabling it in the process.
